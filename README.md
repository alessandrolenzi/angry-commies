F# AngryCommies (Simplified angry birds implementation)


This has been developed as the final project for the Interazione Uomo-Macchina exam in the bachelor degree and submitted as of January 2012. 
It exploits the fsphys module (available on github, please see credits.txt on the same directory) for collision resolution.

The project is featured with a level editor and a gameplay section.
